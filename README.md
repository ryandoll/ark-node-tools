# ARK Node Tools

## server-status.js

Simple example of using Gamedig to pull in our ARK server status. I will probably work it into a larger project once I start fully using the Discord API to create an ARK Bot.

## ark-discord.js

I wanted something quick and simple to tie into our ARK server, and Discord.  I couldn't find anything, so just decided to parse the ARK log itself and kick out those messages to a Discord webhook.  It's crude, but will get the job done for now.  Things will start breaking if they change the format of the logs. But for now...it works!
