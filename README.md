# ark-node-tools

I wanted something quick and simple to tie into our ARK Survival Evolved server, and discord.  I couldn't find anything, so just decided to parse the ARK log itself, and kick out those messages to a Discord webhook.  It's crude, but will get the job done for now.  Things will start breaking if they change the format of the logs, but for now it works!
